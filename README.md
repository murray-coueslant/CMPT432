# CMPT432
A repository which shall contain all of the wonderous adventures I have in CMPT432 - Design of Compilers.

## The Illumi Compiler
The Illumi compiler is written in C# and uses the ASP.NET framework.

## Building the Project

The project is created in ASP.NET, and is interacted with through a web based front end.

To install ASP.NET, follow the instuctions given in [this guide](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet/hello-world-tutorial/intro).

To build the project, first you must clone the repository to your local machine. Once you have done that, the following steps should leave
you with a running version of the compiler which can be accessed by visiting `localhost:5000` or `127.0.0.1:5000`.

Build instructions:
- Ensure that you have the latest version of ASP.NET installed
- Navigate to the cloned version of this repository
- Execute `dotnet run` in the root project folder, for this project that folder is called `Illumi`
- Take note of the address which the compiler is running at, it should be `localhost:5000` but it could be different

Once you have followed these steps, you should be able to interact with the compiler and its functions.
