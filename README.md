A repository which shall contain all of the wonderous adventures I have in CMPT432 - Design of Compilers.

## The Illumi Compiler
The Illumi compiler is written in C# and uses the ASP.NET framework.

The current version of Illumi is command line only.  To use it, see the instructions `Building and Running Illumi`. For the future web 
based version of Illumi, see `Building and Running Illumi for the Web`.

## Building and Running Illumi

Illumi is a .NET console application. It is cross platform, and so can be run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

To use Illumi, you must have the .NET core SDK installed. [This guide](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet/hello-world-tutorial/intro) contains instructions for installing the .NET core.

Once you have installed .NET, follow these instructions to run Illumi on your code.

- Clone this repository
- Navigate to the `Illumi_CLI` folder
- Once inside `Illumi_CLI`, issue `dotnet run` to start Illumi 

That's it! Easy as pie. Once you have started Illumi you will be greeted by its command line interface. To see what Illumi can do, simply 
issue `help` to see the help screen.
